title: Performing for Access Space Digithon July 19th
---

<p>I'm performing via live stream this weekend July 19th-20th for the 24-hour 
	Access Space World Wide Digithon. The event features a world-wide lineup of
	creative artists via the stream. Final schedule is in draft right now.</p>

<p>What is Access Space?</p>

<blockquote>"Access Space is the UK's longest running free, open access digital media lab."</blockquote>
