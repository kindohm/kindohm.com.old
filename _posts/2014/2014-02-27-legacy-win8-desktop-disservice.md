title: "The legacy Windows desktop is not a disservice"
---

Rocky Lhotka recently suggested that 
[Windows 8 users who do not use the new WinRT apps are doing themselves a disservice](http://www.lhotka.net/weblog/TopWin8WinRTApps.aspx):

<blockquote>I know a lot of people who are running Win8 and treating it like 
	Win7 – never leaving the legacy Desktop if at all possible. I think those 
	people are doing themselves a disservice, and in the long run if they are 
	developers then they are doing their users a disservice. I say this because 
	I view the Desktop today in the same light I viewed green screen terminals
	 in the early 1990s – a necessary evil that will ultimately fade into the 
	 mists of time (except for those poor users who will forever be stuck 
	 using legacy apps).</blockquote>

Hmmm, not sure I agree with that. 
But wait, what's that part again about doing my users a disservice?

<blockquote>if they are 
	developers then they are doing their users a disservice</blockquote>

I don't agree with this. I use the Win8 legacy desktop.
I can see that regular Windows desktop/tablet users
are doing themselves a disservice, but I don't understand what disservice I'm doing
to my users as a .NET web/mobile developer. 
I also do not think I'm doing myself a disservice as a developer/musician/consumer. 

Why does a user of my web or mobile app care if I'm using
a Win8 app? Do they care that I'm using a terminal to write code? Don't they just
want useful, bug-free software regardless of what I used to create it?

_Most_ (not all) of what I do in Windows is not available or possible in WinRT.
Even aside from being a developer, most of my apps don't exist on WinRT. 
This includes tasks like authoring music, playing games,
and creating screencasts.

I also don't think that the "green screen terminal" comparison is necessarily a bad thing 
because old console tooling is very much alive and well in software development
(and often times required). Usefulness trumps just being old.

Despite my opinion that the legacy desktop works 
better for me, I still don't understand what that has to do with my users in the long run.

##My Apps

Rocky makes his case by listing the apps he uses regularly on his Win8
computer, and emphasizing which ones are WinRT. His list of WinRT apps is 
very respectable.

Here's my list (WinRT apps are emphasized):

- Visual Studio (desktop) - a dev environment for writing code
- Microsoft Office (desktop) - it's Office
- Sublime Text (desktop) - text editor for writing web code and markdown blog posts
- PowerShell (desktop) - a terminal for development and blogging with Jekyll
- Chrome/Firefox/IE (desktop) - web browsers for development and testing
- **WinRT IE** - the WinRT version of IE for testing. Desktop IE !== WinRT IE.
- FL Studio (desktop) - an audio workstation, for producing music
- Audacity (desktop) - powerful open source audio editing tool
- Minecraft (desktop) - PC game
- VMWare Player (desktop) - for running virtual machines
- Camtasia Studio (desktop) - for creating screencasts
- Kerbal Space Program (desktop) - PC game
- Paint .NET (desktop) - a simple graphics program
- Jungle Disk (desktop) - Amazon S3 file backup
- SuperCollider (desktop) - an audio programming environment
- Pidgin (desktop) - an instant messaging client

Look...  _one_ WinRT app. Apprently me and my users are hurting, right?

With the exception of Chrome, none of my desktop apps are available
in the Windows Store as a WinRT app. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I don't work with photos much. I just dump them somewhere from time to time.
For cloud storage, the OneDrive web UI works wonderfully for me, 
thank you very much. I don't understand how WinRT apps would improve these
experiences for me.

And no, I don't use Facebook, Twitter, news, or weather apps. I don't spend much
time on social media. I usually check the weather once a week on my phone. I read
news and blogs exclusively on my phone.

##Disservice to my users

I'm struggling to understand where the disservice is. I can't use WinRT for
most of my tasks. I'm very productive with the legacy desktop. I don't think the
legacy desktop is hindering me from delivering bug-free software.

<blockquote>"the Desktop ... [is] ... 
a necessary evil that will ultimately fade into the mists of time." </blockquote>

That's fine. Call me old fashioned if you want. But my users don't care. 
They just want great software, right? I'm not doing any disservice to them
or myself by using the legacy desktop.
