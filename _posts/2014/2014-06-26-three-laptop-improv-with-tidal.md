title: Three Laptop Improv with Tidal
---

<blockquote>"One is the loneilest number" - Harry Nilsson</blockquote>

Last night, for the first time, I live-coded music in real time with other people, synced to the same clock. It was much
more fun than I expected it would be. I don't think I appreciated how unique, spontaneous, and fun peer-to-peer 
improv would be. Now I'll go so far as to say that multi-laptop live coding is a sort of rite of passage for
live coders. Achievement unlocked, if you will.

This was done at the monthly <a href="//www.meetup.com/Twin-Cities-Computer-Music-Interest-Group/events/189363692/">Twin 
Cities Computer Music Meetup</a> with Ben Gold and Forrest Cahoon, as we decided to try a <a href="//yaxu.org/tidal">Tidal</a> 
jam session with three laptops. I recorded about 30 minutes of it, which you can listen to below.

Oh, but first, a caveat. I was hosting the session on my laptop, and I use a non-standard set of samples that don't
come with the Dirt synth. Thus, the others weren't as quick to find the sounds they were looking for. Not that you'll be able to
tell though since there are no screens to be shown here.
