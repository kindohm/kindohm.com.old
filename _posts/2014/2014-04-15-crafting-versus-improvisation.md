title: Crafting vs. Improvisation
---

When I started my <a href="http://365tidalpatterns.tumblr.com">365 Tidal Patterns</a>
project, two of my goals were to:

1. Master <a href="http://yaxu.org/tidal">Tidal</a> as best I could

2. Gain practice for live coding performance

After producing 127 patterns on the project, I feel that I have made great 
progress at #1. I feel like I know Tidal really well. However, I feel that
I've made barely any progress at #2.

## Crafting is not improvisation

Live coding is really about improvisation. When I create patterns
for my project, I'm not improvising. I'm designing, tweaking, building, and
being picky. This is crafting, not improvising.

Crafting patterns has allowed me to make progress on my first goal of getting
better with Tidal. I've been able to spend time being critical of sound while
making changes in code to see how the sound reacts. It's a chance to learn
things that I don't understand. It's also kind of a meditative experience that 
I look forward to each day. It's a chance to play and experiment with code and 
sound.

In contrast, improvisation (live coding in particular) requires you to think 
quickly and react as opposed to being critical and tweaking. Crafting patterns
isn't really improvising. Crafting is more like methodical experimentation.

## Practicing Improvisation

If you've been following 365 Tidal Patterns, you may notice that I've increased
the rate at which I've been producing patterns. It used to be a pattern a day.
Now, it's about three patterns a day. I want to follow through with producing
365 patterns, but I don't want to take a year to do it. I want to refocus my
time on live coding performance and improvisation.

Can improvisation be practiced? Of course. Maybe this is an over-simplification,
but just start doing it. Some ideas for practicing the improvisational side
of live coding:

1. Record the live audio of your session and post/publish it. 

2. Do an "on air" Google Hangout broadcast of your live coding session.

3. Record a screen cast and post/publish it.

This is what I did with my "live coding run" on 2014-04-10:

You really don't even need a single audience member for these ideas to be
effective. Just knowing that your content is (or will be) out in the wild is enough to
change your mindset while practicing.
