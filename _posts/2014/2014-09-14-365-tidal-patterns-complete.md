It's done. On December 28th 2013 I set out to create a sound pattern a day with a pattern programming
language called <a href="http://yaxu.org/tidal">Tidal</a>. This was the first pattern:

I finished a bit early, and in doing so kind of broke a soft rule about the point of doing something small every day,
but I don't think that hurt the project at all. Most days I created three patterns, some days up to ten, and toward
the end there were many days with zero. 

Reflecting back, there was a lot that I learned.

<h3>The Goals of the Project</h3>

I had a few goals in mind:

1. learn Tidal
2. get better at live-coding music
3. Create a body of work to reference when talking to people about algorithmic and live-coded music

I absolutely met goals #1 and #3. Goal #2 was met, but not how I expected.

<h3>Crafting versus Improvisation</h3>

One of the first things I learned was that digging in to Tidal wasn't helping me become a better live performer
or a better improviser. Creating a pattern every day helped me develop technical skill with Tidal. I learned 
its syntax and got very familiar with how to create complex sounds. 

However, just because you know how to use a hammer doesn't mean you know how to build a house. Or when you think
of a house as a live-coded performance, it's a house that gets built, painted, decorated, remodeled, demolished, re-built, 
painted, decorated, caught on fire, re-built, and finally demolished (again). You have to manage all that, in addition
to being skilled with the hammer.

Being up on stage for 30 minutes, starting with a blank text file, is unnerving. Knowing a live-coding
programming language's syntax won't help you with this. To become a better performer and improviser, you
have to practice performing and improvising.
