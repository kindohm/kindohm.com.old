It's done. On December 28th 2013 I set out to create a sound pattern a day with a pattern programming
language called <a href="http://yaxu.org/tidal">Tidal</a>. This was the first pattern:

I finished early by about three months. In doing so, I kind of broke a soft rule about the point of doing something small every day.
I don't think that hurt the project at all though. Most days I created three patterns, some days up to ten, and toward
the end there were many days with zero. 

<h3>Is this really the end?</h3>

Probably not! The 365 patterns project has forced me to produce ideas. These ideas are so valuable and I can't justify walking
away from creating them. Stay tuned for pattern number 366!

<h3>Reflection</h3>

Reflecting back, there was a lot that I learned.

Perhaps the biggest lesson I learned is that learning a live-coding language is not the same as practicing improvisation. If you want
to get better at improvisation and performance, then you have to practice improvisation and performance. Learning Tidal and learning how to
get certain sounds out of it was a different process than becoming a better live coder.

I will admit that I got stuck in a rut a few times. Sometimes I'd write variations on the same Tidal functions for days at a time. 
By doing something every day, you start to notice these patterns and you make yourself dig deep to find new inspiration. 
Sometimes the Tidal community would produce an unexpected new feature and inspiration became easy.

In case listening to these patterns one by one isn't your thing, I have 50-pattern mixes of them on SoundCloud:

It is fun to listen to the progression.

....  what is the progression ....
