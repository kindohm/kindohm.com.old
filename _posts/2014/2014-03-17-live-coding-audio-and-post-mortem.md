title: Live Coding from March 14th - audio and post mortem
---

<blockquote>Don't be afraid to take risks.</blockquote>

<p>Last Friday, <a href="/posts/2014/02/26/live-coding-performance-march-14-2014/">I 
	performed some live coding</a> for a very small and appreciative audience. It was
	my first live coding performance, and certainly not my last.</p>

<p>Here's the audio. The venue I performed at asks for a chill/ambient sound
	from their artists, but in hindsight I wish I had taken some more risks with
	<a href="http://yaxu.org/Tidal">Tidal</a>, the live-coding environment that
	I use (more on that down below).</p>

<p><iframe width="100%" height="166" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/140012788&amp;color=ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_artwork=true"> </iframe></p>

<p>The performance didn't go exactly how I imagined it would. Here's what I learned:</p>

<h2>Bring Your Own Sound</h2>

<p>The venue had trouble with their sound board and could only play a single
	channel of my audio. This was a letdown, as a lot of the sounds I enjoy making
	with Tidal rely on stereo interaction. I really don't know what the issue was, as it looked
	like they had a very capable system. In the audio above, you'll notice periods
	of time where nothing seems to be changing (mostly from 00:05:00 - 00:23:00). That was probably when I left my
	keyboard to go find the sound guy to try and resolve the problem.</p>

<p>In my observations so far, live coders squeeze their way into many non-traditional
	environments. This means we cannot make any assumptions about how our 
	performance and gear can be supported. </p>

<p>Next time, I'm coming prepared with
	my own portable mixer and sound monitors.</p>

<h2>Take Risks</h2>

<p>I left the gig wanting more and feeling like I hadn't done enough. I
	tweeted this:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Had fun live coding last night. a little too cautious with the small &amp; appreciative audience. Will try to melt a few faces at the next one</p>&mdash; Mike Hodnick (@kindohm) <a href="https://twitter.com/kindohm/statuses/444823214913376256">March 15, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>I wanted to respect the venue's wishes for a chill environment, but I ended up
	using Tidal more as a mixer and less as its own instrument. I could have
	achieved an appropriate sound for the venue without under-utilizing Tidal.</p>

<p>The audio above doesn't sound much like my <a href="http://365tidalpatterns.tumblr.com">365 Tidal Patterns</a>
	clips.</p>

<p>Tidal allows a computer to turn into an instrument. It allows you to create
	new sounds from blended, crushed, and chopped samples that don't resemble
	their originals. I didn't really use Tidal to its full potential. However,
	I had a small audience so it wasn't anything to be disappointed about. 
	I also feel that just getting
	out and doing live coding was more important than "doing it right". But it
	has now made me thirst for a more genuine performance with the 
	capabilities of Tidal.</p>

<p><a href="http://meta-ex.com">Meta-Ex</a>, a live-coding duo from the U.K., 
	responded to my tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kindohm">@kindohm</a> It&#39;s the real risk inherent in live coding that makes the performances palpable. We need to find new ways to show and surf risk!</p>&mdash; Meta-eX (@meta_ex) <a href="https://twitter.com/meta_ex/statuses/445467545660051456">March 17, 2014</a></blockquote>

<p>I agree! Live coding is a very new and emerging type of performance in the U.S. and
	we have an opportunity to shape it. Might as well make it into what
	we want by taking some risks.</p>

<h2>Have Fun and Be Genuine</h2>

<p>I think there is overlap between
	taking risks and having fun (at least for those of us with unusual tastes
	in music and audio). We should give the performance that we really want
	to give.</p>

<p>I was really curious to see how the audience would react to the performance.
	Even though there was a small handful of people, it was the times when they encouraged
	me to do something unique or showed an interest in what was going on ("hey,
	what does <em>that</em> sample in that folder do?") that something interesting
	started to happen. It was when I wanted to try something fun (e.g. taking a
	risk) that something good eeked out.</p>

<h2>The Future</h2>

<p>This is just the start! There are a few upcoming dates where I'll be doing
	some live coding (not all in a public performance sense). </p>

<p>First, there's a new Twin Cities Computer Music group that is just getting
	started. A few of us are meeting at Dev Jam Studios later this month to
	<em>share our screens</em> and show each other what we're interested in.
	Despite the generic "computer music" group name, it is programming/live-code
	focused.</p>

<p>Second, I'll be talking about what I've learned and discovered about the
	world of live coding at <a href="http://twincitiescodecamp.com">Twin
	Cities Code Camp</a> on Saturday, April 5th. I'll be doing a short
	performance as part of my presentation. In addition to Tidal, I'm hoping to
	show and demonstrate <a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a>. I have
	three weeks to learn it!</p>

<p>Third, there's a live coding jam session scheduled for August 6th, 2014 at
	Dev Jam Studios in Minneapolis. No concrete details yet.</p>

<p>Of course, I will be seeking out another solo gig... unless I can convince
	someone else in Minneapolis to get into Tidal!</p>
