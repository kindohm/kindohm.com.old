		I'll be performing some live-coded, improvisational sound with a computer at 
		<a href="http://thebeatcoffee.com">The Beat Coffeehouse</a> in uptown
		Minneapolis on March 14th, 2014 at 7:00 PM. As far as I know, this will be 
		<strong>the first ever live coding event in Minneapolis!</strong></p>

	<p>I've been trying to find a venue to play out with <a href="//yaxu.org/tidal">Tidal</a>
		for a couple of months. A coffee shop isn't exactly what I had in mind, but
		The Beat Coffeehouse has a great stage area and already has a built-in
		projector and screen. It should be a great place to try this for the first
		time. The only real challenge is that the venue asks performers to comply
		with a chill/ambient sound - and ultimately not scare away their customers.
		I'll have to tone down the types of sounds I've been working with in Tidal...
		or some of you crazy, noise-loving folks will just have to attend.</p>

	<p>As of today, the venue hasn't put me on their events calendar, but their
		calendar is here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheBeatCoffee/events">https://www.facebook.com/TheBeatCoffee/events</a>.</p>

	<p>Hope you see you there!</p>
