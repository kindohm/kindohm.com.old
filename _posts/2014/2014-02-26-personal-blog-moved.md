title: "My personal/technical blog has moved"
---

<p>If you're looking for good-old posts about programming with .NET, Kinect,
	ASP.NET, WPF, and web development, then please redirect your feed
	aggregator to <a href="http://mikehodnick.com">mikehodnick.com</a>. 
	kindohm.com is now my home for all things computer-music. </p>

<p>It was a tough decision to move the blog, but it was for the best thing
	to do for a variety of reasons that I won't get in to.</p>

<p>If you're currently subscribed to kindohm.com, then you're probably getting
	some RSS spam at the moment. My apologies.</p>
