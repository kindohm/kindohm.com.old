title: Recap of Live Coding at TCCC16
---

This past weekend was the 16th Twin Cities Code Camp. I presented on live coding,
including some of its history, what makes it a unique type of performance,
why it is relevant to us today, and examples of live coding performances. I also 
gave a brief live coding performance at the end, but it kind of failed in an
ironic way. More on that in a minute....

##Demo Materials

You can listen to the captured audio from the end of my demo here:

And the source code for it (which is arguably meaningless without context, as
I talked about in my presentation), is here:

##Interest and Feedback

First off, I was surprised and thrilled to see how many people showed up to 
learn about live coding! Live coding is not well-known in the U.S., so it is
really cool to see the interest. When I asked the audience how many of them knew
what live coding was only a couple people raised their hands. I am a fresh, 
amateur live coder and my hope is that I was able to generate some excitement
about live coding. I hope I did the topic justice!

I received a little bit of kind feedback via Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Live Coding <a href="https://twitter.com/kindohm">@kindohm</a> . Thanks for the great session. Enjoyed it!

You may notice the crowd _behind_ me watching. Again, more on that in a minute...

##Audience Discussion

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Some challenging questions posed at <a href="https://twitter.com/kindohm">@kindohm</a>&#39;s talk. Great q&amp;a back and forth. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tccc16&amp;src=hash">#tccc16</a></p>&mdash; JudahGabriel Himango (@JudahGabriel) <a href="https://twitter.com/JudahGabriel/statuses/452532172725841920">April 5, 2014</a></blockquote>

Some good dialog was created during my talk when someone in the audience asked
"why should we care" whether the live coding embraces transparency. What is the
point whether the performer is showing their screen?  "Why do I give a damn?"

I think these are great questions. 

I did my best at explaining my opinion that by showing our screens we are creating
an authentic and genuine performance. We do not hide behind our technology. It
becomes evident that the performer may have spent years (maybe decades) honing
their performance skills with hours of practice. These things are valuable
because it allows the performer and computer to be respected as a performance
artist and instrument. Does that mean that jumping up and down at a club performance
to a DJ behind a table with unseen gadgety hardware is not meaningful?
Not at all. It is just different, and before live coding we didn't have the
distinction between those two types of electronic performances.

##Environments

I showed performance examples of the following environments:

- <a href="http://yaxu.org/tidal">Tidal</a>
- <a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a>
- <a href="http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/">Supercollider</a>
- <a href="http://benswift.me/extempore-docs/">Extempore</a>
- <a href="http://www.ixi-audio.net/ixilang/">IXI lang</a>
- <a href="http://gibber.mat.ucsb.edu/">Gibber</a>
- <a href="http://livecodelab.net/play/index.html">Live Code Lab</a>

##The Ironically Failed Demo

After talking for 50 minutes about the value of transparency, my live
coding laptop decided it didn't want to recognize the projector. After all the
build-up, I couldn't show my screen. I couldn't believe it. You couldn't have
imagined more perfect timing.

In retrospect, a reboot probably would 
have resolved the issue, but while thinking on my feet I never thought of
that option.

To improvise, I asked interested audience members to come around and watch
me do live coding. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Gathering around for <a href="https://twitter.com/kindohm">@kindohm</a>&#39;s live coded music. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23tccc16&amp;src=hash">#tccc16</a> <a href="http://t.co/bHjRlas3Bl">pic.twitter.com/bHjRlas3Bl</a></p>&mdash; speakrcc (@speakrcc) <a href="https://twitter.com/speakrcc/statuses/452541241738027009">April 5, 2014</a></blockquote>

It was the next best thing. It was disappointing that the entire crowd wasn't
able to really see what was going on, but I think (and hope) the presentation still
made sense and resonated with most people. 

##Sparking Interest

I talked to a number of folks afterward who showed a lot of interest in 
getting started with live coding. I know I was able to persuade at least one
person in actually getting something installed and running:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/kindohm">@kindohm</a> got Haskell and tidal working on OSX. I can use screenflow to capture cid and audio.</p>&mdash; Brian P. Hogan (@bphogan) <a href="https://twitter.com/bphogan/statuses/452868240335990784">April 6, 2014</a></blockquote>

##Conclusion

I would love to see live coding become a more regular type of performance in
the upper Midwest of the US. I really enjoyed talking about the history, 
significance, and uniqueness of live coding to programmers in the Twin Cities
area.

If you attended my talk and are looking for more information, you best bet is
to head to <a href="http://toplap.org">TOPLAP.org</a> for news, more history,
and links to live coding environments.
