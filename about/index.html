  <h1 class="big thin">Mike Hodnick</h1>

  <p>
    I am an independent software developer and live in the Minneapolis / 
    St. Paul area. I primarily do full-stack web development in .NET 
    (ASP.NET MVC, Web API, Azure, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc) but also go pretty
    deep in other technologies. Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> -
    I would love to help you build your next great thing.
  </p>

  <p>In addition to writing code to build software, I also write code to create
    live, improvised sound using live-coding environments. You might find me
    at a local food-n-drink establishment coding up some chill/ambient sounds,
    but I also love producing crazy noise. Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a>
    if you're interested in a performance, talk, or demonstration of live-coding.</p>

  <h2>Misc Interests and Activities</h2>

  <h2>Musical Influences &amp; Likes</h2>
  <p>I have an odd taste in music. Here's why: Keelhaul, Melvins, Melt-Banana, 
    Battles, Helmet, Aphex Twin/AFX/Polygon Window, Edgey, Fleet Foxes, I Broke My Robot,
    Eight Frozen Modules, anything related to Max Cavalera, Deerhoof, Modeselektor,
    Current Value/Limewax, anything related to Mike Patton, Failure, All, Sonic Youth,
    Primus, Enduser, Kettel, EPROM, The Fiery Furnaces, Figure, Iron Reagan, 
    Vector Lovers, Xanopticon.</p>    

  <h2>Musical Background</h2>
  <p>I started studying piano at Age 7 and began studying classical percussion
    and drumset at age 12. I played in school wind ensembles, string orchestras,
    and jazz bands. In my parents' basement I was a rock drummer (a special thank you
    to Helmet, Led Zeppelin, Rush, Primus, Soundgarden, and 311). </p>

  <p>In high school and college I was very fortunate to play percussion with the
    <a href="http://www.dsso.com/">Duluth-Superior Symphony Orchestra</a>. I 
    performed in works such as Shostakovich's 5th and Rachmoninoff's Symphonic Dances.</p>

  <p>In college I played drums in jazz combos. I also played timbales in an Afro-Cuban
    ensemble (timbales, congas, bongos, bass, guitar, piano, horns).</p>

  <p>After college I immersed myself in home recording and attempted writing
    my own music.</p>

  <p>Fast forward to the recent past, where I became more interested in
    computer-based electronic production and audio synthesis. I also gained
    an interest in programming and audio synthesis and producing sound with
    code.</p>

  <p>Then along comes 2013 and I discover this thing called Live Coding.</p>
