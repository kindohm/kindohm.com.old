  <h1 class="big thin">Mike Hodnick</h1>

  <p>
    I am an independent software developer and live in the Minneapolis / 
    St. Paul area. I primarily do full-stack web development in .NET 
    (ASP.NET MVC, Web API, Azure, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, etc) but also go pretty
    deep in other technologies. Feel free to <a href="/contact">contact me</a> -
    I would love to help you build your next great thing.
  </p>

  <p>In addition to writing code to build software, I also write code to create
    live, improvised sound using live-coding environments. You might find me
    at a local food-n-drink establishment coding up some chill/ambient sounds,
    but I also love producing crazy noise. Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a>
    if you're interested in a performance, talk, or demonstration of live-coding.</p>

  <p>I also play ice hockey, cook, and play Minecraft and Kerbal
    Space Program.</a>
