  <h1 class="big thin">Mike Hodnick</h1>

  <p>
    I am an independent software developer and live in the Minneapolis, MN, USA 
    area. I primarily do full-stack web development with .NET and open source
    technologies but also go pretty deep in non-web areas. Feel free to 
    <a href="/contact">contact me</a> - I would love to help you build your next great thing.
  </p>

  <p>In addition to writing code to build software, I also write code to create
    live, improvised sound using live-coding environments. Live coding is in its 
    infancy in the U.S. These days you'll find me performing live at programming
    events, user groups, or the occasional coffee house. Please <a href="/contact">contact me</a>
    if you're interested in a performance, talk, or demonstration of live-coding.</p>
